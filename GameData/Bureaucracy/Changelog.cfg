    }  
  	    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.6
		change = Bureaucracy will now yield control of the science system back to Kerbalism when not running in a Career game.
		change = Fixed an issue where Bureaucracy would incorrectly believe the time to be Y1D1 the first time it is used in a save, even if it was an existing save.
		change = Added setting to turn off Messages (SuppressMessages) (bool).
		change = Settings version updated to 1.6. Previous version 1.4.0.1 - upgrading from a version of Bureaucracy prior to 1.4.0.1 will result in settings being reset to defaults.
		change = Barring any major issues being found this will be the last release of Bureaucracy. I'd like to thank you all for your support over the last 7 years.
    }  
  
	    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.5.1

	    VERSION

        version = 1.5
		change = Recompile against KSP 1.12.2 - not compatible with 1.11.x or earlier.
		change = Add support for OPM in the CBK config (thanks Gordon-Dry)
        change = Alarms are now handled by the stock Alarm Clock (thanks R-T-B).
		change = Added "Bank of Kerbin" script. You can now store and withdraw funds (no auto-allocation right now, that will come later).
		change = UI now properly scrolls - this indirectly fixes the issue where the Crew Training dialog would go off screen.
		change = Retirement dates will no longer be saved if Retirement is disabled.
		change = Retirement dates will now correctly regenerate if Retirement is re-enabled after being disabled.
		change = Mod will add an alarm for when Kerbals are going to be done training.

    }
    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.4
        change = Kerbals can now retire and will be assigned a random retirement date on first load. They can delay their retirement date by running missions (Credit for the idea to the RP-1 team, code is my own)

        change = UI windows will no longer lock all control
        change = UI windows can be toggled by clicking the toolbar icon again
        change = New Settings: RetirementEnabled, RetirementExtensionFactor, MinimumTerm, MaximumTerm, BaseTrainingFee - see wiki for more details.
        change = Save Upgrade Pipeline updated to run from 1.1 to 1.4. Saves from a version of Bureaucracy prior to 1.1 will be reset to default. If in doubt, check the version in BureaucracySettings.cfg
    change = Properly handle the observatory from ResearchBodies

    }

    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.2

        change = Fixed an issue where the mod wouldn't function properly if the first game loaded was a Sandbox save

    {
        version = 1.1.1
        change = Fixed issue where "incremental progress" would try and catch up from Y1 D1 the first time the mod is loaded. The fix is retroactive, so you may see this bug one more time when launching the save after upgrading.
    }

    VERSION
    {
        version = 1.1
